# Orchestra-backend 
This repo is a Rails backend of my Orchestra project. I decided to have two seperate repositories for this project and therefore the link to the javascript frontend of this project is https://github.com/JOCOghub/JS-project-frontend . This project uses AJAX and javascript to make fetch requests to this rails backend to access a database containing information about varried orchestras and the instruments that make them up.
## Installation
Clone this repository to run.

### Usage
* Type the following below in your terminal to startup the backend server. Then navigate to the frontend and use the command (for mac) open index.html to access the frontend browser
* ```$ bundle install```
* ```$ rake db:migrate```
* ```$ rails s```
